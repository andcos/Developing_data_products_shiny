The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper 
The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called
 Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of 
 three related species.Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked 
 on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
 Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the
 combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

The data set is approximated by the closest tree with some penalty for the excessive number of nodes, bending and stretching.
 Then the so-called "metro map" is constructed. The data points are projected into the closest node. For each node the pie
 diagram of the projected points is prepared. The area of the pie is proportional to the number of the projected points. 
 It is clear from the diagram (left) that the absolute majority of the samples of the different Iris species belong to 
 the different nodes. Only a small fraction of Iris-virginica is mixed with Iris-versicolor (the mixed blue-green nodes in
 the diagram). Therefore, the three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) are separable by the
 unsupervising procedures of nonlinear principal component analysis. To discriminate them, it is sufficient just to select
 the corresponding nodes on the principal tree.
